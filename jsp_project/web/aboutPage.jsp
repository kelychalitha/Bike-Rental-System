            <h3> Why Buy from Us?</h3>
            <p><b>Customer Service is our first priority.</b> We are here to serve YOU and help you enjoy cycling! We treat ALL of our customers with the same attention and respect, whether you are a first-time buyer or a long-time friend, and whether you want to ride a bicycle for fitness, competition, saving gasoline, or family fun!</p>

            <p><b>Become a Preferred Customer!</b> When you purchase a bicycle from us, you are automatically a Preferred Customer, which entitles you to all of these benefits:</p>
            <ul list="circle">
                <li>15% discount off all regularly-priced parts, clothing, and accessories purchased on the same day as the bicycle</li>
                <li>Free 90-Day Safety Check-Up on your new bike</li>
                <li>Free Turbo Bikes T-Shirt!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Professional Assembly</b> by expert mechanics is included for all bicycles. We pride ourselves on taking the time and effort to do a better job. The big-box stores do not have the experience nor the time to ensure that your bicycle is assembled to be safe and work right, the first time.</p>

            <p><b>We'll Fit You Right.</b> Buying the wrong-sized bicycle can mean the different between comfort and pain, fast and slow, safe and unsafe. We'll help you select the bicycle that is the correct size for you, and make any adjustments that are necessary to fine-tune the fit to your needs.</P>

            <p><b>Dedicated and Experienced Staff.</b> We have a core group of long-term employees who are passionate about bikes and love to share that passion. This means that when you visit us, you'll see familiar faces that you know. And more importantly, we'll get to know you (and your bike)!</p>

            <p><b>Support the local economy!</b> We are a locally-owned small business, and we try to support other local businesses when making our buying decisions!</p>

            <p><b>Community Service </b>is important to us. This includes the sponsoring the award-winning Bike To School Challenge, participating in corporate health and wellness fairs, Adopt-A-Highway Litter Control, children's safety presentations, maintenance and repair classes, support of local organizations' fund-raising efforts, and providing support and sponsorship for charity rides such as the Bike MS Buckeye Breakaway. We are a Member Bike Shop of Bike Cleveland and the Adventure Cycling Association.</p>

            <p><b>Environmentally Aware.</b> We recycle cardboard and aluminum, and use recycled paper and biodegradable products whenever possible. We continue to look for additional ways to reduce our impact on our planet's environment.</P>
