                    <p><h2>Book online.</h2>
                    Please use our online booking request form to help avoid dissapointment.</br></br>

                    <h2>Bring your own Helmet and Gloves.</h2>
                    This will mean we have less to disinfect, so more time to spend on you.</br></br>

                    <h2>Do payment</h2>
                    We ask that you only pay using a debit or credit card or cash.</br></br>

                    <h2>Ride within your limits.</h2>
                    We would like to try and reduce first aid incidents to as near zero as possible - know your ability and stick within it.</br></br>

                    <h2>Be Patient.</h2>
                    We are going to take a wee while to get to grips with new procedures, please be tolerant of our dilly dallying.</br></br></p>
